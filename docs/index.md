### The Three Spaces Framework

#### 1. First Space — Home / Private Life**
The **first space** is where personal identity and relationships are formed.  
It’s where we **rest, reflect, and simply be**.  
- Focus: self, family, belonging  
- Characteristics: comfort, safety, reflection  
- Example: home, garden, personal studio

#### 2. Second Space — Work / Institutional Life  
The **second space** is where we engage in structured, purposeful activity.  
It’s defined by **roles, responsibilities, and outcomes**.  
- Focus: productivity, structure, hierarchy  
- Characteristics: order, accountability, efficiency  
- Example: workplace, school, organization

#### 3. Third Space — Community / Shared Life  
The **third space** bridges the first two.  
It’s where people **meet informally**, share ideas, and create together.  
- Focus: connection, collaboration, creativity  
- Characteristics: openness, experimentation, belonging  
- Example: cafe, maker space, library, co-op, community garden, Discord server
