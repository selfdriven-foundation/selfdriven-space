## Composed – Generated Spaces

**Spaces that emerge through composition, synthesis, or generation.**
- AI-generated environments, simulations, or knowledge spaces.
- Composed narratives, models, or frameworks that give structure to learning.
- Hybrid layers that mix physical and virtual into new forms of interaction.
- Spaces that “self-organise” around intent, activity, or community patterns.
